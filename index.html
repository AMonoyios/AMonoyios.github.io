        - Welcome to my first ever live website! I am a passionate and ambitious game developer with a strong focus on creating immersive and innovative gaming experiences. I’m always striving to push boundaries and explore new ideas to deliver projects that are both exciting and meaningful.<br><br>
        - This website started out as a passion project with main aim to re-learn html css and javascript, in no time this ended up being the window into my professional and personal journey. Here, you’ll find a showcase of my projects, current aspirations, and upcoming endeavors. Whether you’re a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just someone curious about what I do, I hope you’ll find inspiration in the work I’ve poured my heart into.<br><br>
        - Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out through the <a href="about.html">contact</a> page.
